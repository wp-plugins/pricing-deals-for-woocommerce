		- "Coupon Discount" places the discount in a Plugin-specific Woo coupon
		- "Unit Cost Discount" is the new default
		
* Enhancement - Added Settings Switch to show *Catalog Price discount suffix*, with wildcards.

		by putting in "Save {price_save_percent} or {price_save_amount}" 
		and the plugin will automatically fill in the saved percentage as "25%".

		prior to the code changes and the issues
		these customers are experiencing.
