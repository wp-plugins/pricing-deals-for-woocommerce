Pricing Deals is many plugins in one!

*   *Catalog Pricing*
     - Show the discount in the catalog pricing. (by Logged-in Role (Wholesaler, Membership), Category, and others). 
*   *Sale Pricing*
     - Use a single rule to put an entire Category (or other group) on sale.  Just like having a sale price on a product, except
     -    a single rule can apply to a big group, without updating each product individually!!!      
*   *Cart Discounts*
     - Dynamic pricing in the cart, by just about any grouping or deal you can think of. 
*   *Marketing*
     - Advertise your Deals using Shortcodes!
*   *by Category*
     - Example: "T-Shirts 10% off - 1 day sale"  
*   *by Group*
     - Example: "Buy 3 Carrots for $5" 
*   *Buy One, Get One*
     - Example: "Buy a Laptop, get 2nd Laptop 20% off"
*   *Role Pricing*
    - Example: "Members get 20% off"

     - Example: "One per customer"
